#SFANet-crowd-counting
This is an unofficial implement of the arXiv paper [Dual Path Multi-Scale Fusion Networks with Attention for Crowd Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01115) by PyTorch. 

##Prerequisite
Python 3.7

Pytorch 1.1.0

##Code structure
`density_map.py` To generate the density map and attention map. 

`dataset.py` and `transforms.py` For data preprocess and augmentation. 

`models.py` The structure of the network. 

`train.py` To train the model. 

##Result
The network is training now, I will upload results and checkpoints soon.
